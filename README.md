# Gapminder-project
Gapminder has collected a lot of information about how people live their lives in different countries, tracked across the years, and on a number of different indicators.
The dataset was analysed to answer the following questions:
1) For countries that have a lower literacy rate, how does the female literacy rate compare to the male literacy rate?

2) What is the level of education distribution for men? Does the level of education have a correlation with the sectors these men are employed in?

3) Does higher GDP per capita translate to higher CO2 emission per capita?

4) In females which cancer is more prevalent now?
